# BACKGROUND

For the final group project of the Data Analyst bootcamp at WILD CODE SCHOOL in Lyon, we were given carte blanche to choose the subject. With my team, we chose to develop an air pollution forecasting tool.

# OBJECTIVE & CHALLENGES

To carry out an air pollution forecast for the city of Lyon, we first had to correlate the pollutant levels provided by ATMO FRANCE with the climatic data supplied by OPEN-METEO, over 4 consecutive years. A phase of data processing and preparation was necessary to build a dataset gathering relevant data for our work. We then trained a machine learning model on our new database and, using the climate forecast data provided by OPEN-METEO, were able to predict the level of air pollutants in the city of Lyon. Based on the thresholds used to calculate the air quality index according to ATMO FRANCE, we were able to predict whether air quality in the city of Lyon would be good, poor or bad over several days.

# EXPECTED DELIVERABLE

Une application permettant aux utilisateurs de conna√Ætre l'indice de qualit√© de l'air sur plusieurs jours. Des recommandations sanitaires sont donn√©es aux utilisateurs en fonction de l'√©tat de l'indice de qualit√© de l'air.
